# Final Project
*Due Date: Tuesday, October 6 - 5pm EST*

The final project will require you to complete:
- two Python scripts (including comment codes within the script),
- a short 600 – 800 word write up about _both_ scripts, and
- delivery via a Github repository that contains both scripts and the write-up in the `README` file.

**Documentation is absolutely critical:** you should have a clear comment block at the top of all scripts with author, date, Python version, input/output information as well as several comments within your code to explain what each part of it does.

## Details on the scripts:
**Script 1:** This will be similar to a lab and you will be given instructions to follow along and modify the script to get a particular result.

**Script 2:** This will be a script that responds to the code challenges relating to processing a survey in a text file. You will begin this script by working through the tutorials provided, which will help give you a lot of the initial code for importing files to Colab, and get you started.

## Details about the write up:
Your write up should clearly and succinctly describe __both__ scripts. Your submitted repo need only include one `README` (that contains the write-up) and two script files. [See this example for how to structure your repo.](https://github.com/IDCE-MSGIS/sample-lab/tree/master)

**Script 1:**, Briefly explain the purpose of the script, how well it functioned (or if it didn’t), and whether or not you might use something like this in the future.

**Script 2:** clearly explain what you are trying to do: even though there will be prompts in the tutorial, you should reframe these in your own words. While your comment code will help someone reviewing the code understand what it does, youre write-up should expand on these an offer more detail. Additionally, you should describe the process of writing the script: was it easy, hard, what challenges or errors did you face and how did you resolve them? If you use any resources to help write your code (e.g. Stackoverflow.com; the text book; etc.), please link to them in the body of your text. E.g. “After repeated syntax errors, I checked [Stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/help/referencing) to find that…”  Use Markdown to format your text and link to a specific online resources that you used.

Remember: when this project is complete, we can transfer ownership of this repo to you so it will appear in your Github account and be something you can use to demonstrate your technical ability coming out of this class: so make this count! You can also use [Github's "Issues" functionality](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to communicate directly with your partner via Github (you can also tag Shashank and I for questions!).
