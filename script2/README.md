Script 1:

The code extracted weather information of Worecester MA from the National Weather Service website. It also modified the results by converting the final output to uppercase. In addition, by using the replace() function, it fixed the spacing issues with the output. Fortunately I did not run into any major issues during coding. I had some syntax erros, for example, forgot to put a colon in a for loop.  I think this script would be helpful in the future becasue it can help me extract large amounts of data from websites in an easily analyze format. 

Script 2: 

The code challenge 1 includes a function that indicates the name of the county and the number of votes that county recieved. 

I came across a problem while trying to count the number of votes for a particular county. The error message said:"local variable 'count' referenced before assignment; count outside the function.I fixed the problem by moving the line count = 0 in the function rather than leave it in the outside.
